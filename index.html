<p>Each year, Cornell students have difficulty finding the perfect housing for the upcoming
academic year. Many Cornell students do not have a car as they often travel from distant
locations via plane, so finding an apartment that lends itself to walking is extremely
important. These convenient locations are extremely desireable, so they also typically have
extremely high rent. Sifting through the available listings to find an apartment in a good,
walkable location with reasonable rent is difficult, primarily due to the lack of useful tools
that facilitate obtaining the necessary information to compare different options and to make
the right decision. Although Cornell does offer the Off Housing Listing Service
( https://sf‐sas‐app‐002.serverfarm.cornell.edu:7793/och ), it simply gives a list of all the
housing depending on the filters selected and does not provide much insight unless the
student already knows what specific type of housing one is looking for.</p>

<p>By plotting available housings on an interactive map and providing different visual cues for
the rent and the walkability, we believe our visualization greatly helps students spot
affordable as well as convenient housings at a glance. A student unfamiliar with Ithaca that is
looking for housing can easily see how the walkability of an apartment location translates to
the cost of rent in this area. In addition, an outlier that has a good Walk Score but also fairly
cheap rent will be clearly identified as a green, opaque point, so someone searching for an
apartment can easily find them. Lastly, the ability to hover over a point to get more
information about a listing provides a good balance of information ‐ the map doesn’t cause
information overload at a glance, but all of the data is easily available if someone is
interested in a particular listing.</p>

<h2>
<a id="data" class="anchor" href="#data" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data</h2>

<p>First, we obtained the off‐campus housing data from Cornell University’s Off Campus Housing
Listing Services (https://sf‐sas‐app‐002.serverfarm.cornell.edu:7793/och). We wrote a jQuery
script to scrape the data and save it as a json file. This first set of data included:
● Address : the address of the housing</p>

<p>● Date available : when the housing is available
● Neighborhood : region which the housing belongs to
● Rent : rent per month
● Lease length : minimum length of the lease
● Bedrooms : number of rooms
● Distance : distance from Cornell University</p>

<p>To allow users to compare rent more easily across all housings regardless of the bedroom
counts, we created an extra variable: rent per person. We divided the rent by the number of
bedrooms, assuming that each bedroom (including the studio) will hold only one person</p>

<p>● Rent per person : arithmetic average of rent per bedroom</p>

<p>Second, to quantify the walkability of each housing, we collected Walk Scores from
WalkScore.com ( <a href="https://www.walkscore.com">https://www.walkscore.com</a> ). Then, to later plot housings on a map, we
converted each address into latitude and longitude using LatLong.net
( <a href="http://www.latlong.net">http://www.latlong.net</a> ). So our second set of data included:
● Address : the address of the housing
● Walk Score : Walk Score of the housing
● Latitude : latitude coordinate of the address
● Longitude : longitude coordinate of the address
Next, we needed to clean and merge our data. We noticed some unreasonable values for the
rent: for example, the rent for a housing with 4 bedrooms located in Collegetown was
$600/month, which clearly seemed like it was the rent for one bedroom in a 4 bedroom
housing rather than the rent for all 4 bedrooms. So, taking the number of bedrooms and the
location into consideration, we re‐examined the rent per person for each listing (paying close
attention to housings with less than $400 rent per person). Finally, our JavaScript code that
powers the visualization merges these two data sets as its first step, using the address as the
key, so that all of the data can be used easily.</p>

<h2>
<a id="visualization" class="anchor" href="#visualization" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Visualization</h2>

<p>We wanted to visualize our data on a single map so that the users can easily determine
whether the rent is reasonable based on the location and whether that place convenient for
those without a car. We used Google Maps API to provide zooming, local businesses and
services information, and street views and used the JavaScript D3 library to plot each listing
on the map as a circle.</p>

<p>We used color to represent different levels of rent per bedroom. As it is common that green is
used for indicating underbudget and red is used for indicating overbudget, we set the color
from green to red as a linear scale for the domain of 100‐1800. We hardcoded this scale for
our dataset (and set our slider to match) rather than simply using the minimum and maximum
rent values because otherwise a single outlier could completely skew the results. This would
still be valid if this dataset were to be updated in the future as rent in Ithaca does not change
that drastically from year‐to‐year, but may need to be changed if this were to be reused with
another location (such as San Francisco, for example).</p>

<p>var colorScale = d3.scale.linear().domain([100,900,1800]).range(["green","yellow","red"]);</p>

<p>We used opacity to represent different levels of Walk Score. In order to help our users to
more easily identify housings that are convenient for living, we set higher opacity for those
with high Walk Scores (so that they are more visible) and lower opacity for those with lower
Walk Scores. Note that a WalkScore of zero does not make the point fully transparent, as we
want those locations to still be visible on the map ‐ thus, the opacity ranges from 0.2 to 1. In
addition, regardless of the Walk Score the border of the point is fully opaque, to make sure
the points can be found easily.</p>

<p>var opacityScale = d3.scale.linear().domain([0,100]).range([0.2,1]);</p>

<p>In order to make our data circles more noticeable, we transformed the map which originally
had many colors into grayscale, so that the color scale we used to indicate the cost of rent
was more noticeable.</p>

<p>By using D3 and jQuery, we created three filters which dynamically updates the points on the
map based on the criteria of the user, so that they can find all the possible housing within
their budget and desired walkability and ignore listings that aren’t suitable (such as those
with many bedrooms when they intend on living by themselves):</p>

<p>● Room type selector : Number of bedrooms in the apartment (or Studio)
● Rent selector : Selects the range of rent per bedroom ‐ when a new Room Type is
selected, this will change to match the minimum and maximum rent per person of that
room type.
● Walk Score selecto r: Walk Score from 0 to 100</p>

<p>Finally, we added a hover‐over action to each data circle to display a popup information
window that displays more detailed information for that housing such as neighborhood,
distance to Cornell, date available, lease length, etc., to make that data available in case the
user is interested in a particular listing without incurring information overload on the main
map.</p>
